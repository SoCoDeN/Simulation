The following guidelines to create the datasets are as follows:
* **Number of subjects**: 10,000
* **Number of waves/time-points per subject:** 7 (about every two years)
* **Age:** 7-20 years
    * Wave 1 – 7-8 years-of-age
    * Wave 2 – 9-10 years-of-age
    * Wave 3 – 11-12 years-of-age
    * Wave 4 – 13-14 years-of-age
    * Wave 5 – 15-16 years-of-age
    * Wave 6 – 17-18 years-of-age
    * Wave 7 – 19-20 years-of-age 
* **Sex:** 0: male (approximately 50%), 1: female (approximately 50%)
* **Cognitive measures:** IQ (mean = 100, standard deviation = 15)
* **Behavioral measures:** internalizing and externalizing symptoms and attention problems scale based on child behavior checklist (CBCL)
* **Autism diagnosis:** 0: no, 1: yes
* **Brain volume measures:** intracranial volume, total gray matter volume, total white matter volume, hippocampal volume, amygdala volume, and cortical thickness of frontal lobe. The units should be in mm3. Each group determines the starting point and trajectory of each brain measure 
* **Parental Education:** 0: less than 12th grade (5.3%), 1: High School or GED (35.4%), 2: Bachelor’s Degree (25.3%), 3: Master’s or higher degree (34%)

**Attrition/Missing data:** Missing timepoints 20% \
**Effect size, noise:** Each group should decide what effect size and amount of noise they would like to include
